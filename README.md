# Apple-Calculator-Rebuild
This project is a recreation of the popular Apple calculator made using SwiftUI as the programming language. The calculator has been designed to closely mimic the functionality and design of the original while also featuring a self-mimicked designed app icon.

##Features
**Basic Mathematical Operations:** The calculator supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Percentage Calculation: `(In the near future)`** Using the percentage button, percentages can be calculated effortlessly.

**Sign Change: `(In the near future)`** It is possible to change the sign of a number by using the "+/-" button.

**Clear and Reset:** The "AC" button allows clearing the current input value.

**Continuous Computation:** The calculator enables continuous computation, allowing one operation in sequence. 

## Installation
To use the calculator on your iOS device, first clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/N3v1/Apple-Calculator-Rebuild.git
```
Then, open the Xcode project file Calculator.xcodeproj and run the app on your simulator or connected device.
